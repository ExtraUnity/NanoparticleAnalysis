# NanoAnalyzer
**NanoAnalyzer** is a user-friendly application for automated segmentation and analysis of supported nanoparticles in electron microscopy images (TEM and STEM).  
It combines a U-Net–based deep learning model with an intuitive graphical interface, allowing materials researchers to:

- segment nanoparticles without writing code,
- process entire folders of images in batch,
- extract particle-level statistics (area, equivalent circular diameter, size distributions),
- and optionally train new models on their own annotated datasets.

NanoAnalyzer is developed by Christian Vedel Petersen & Nikolaj Nguyen originally as part of their bachelor's thesis at the Technical University of Denmark, and later as part of a study on **accessible deep learning for automated segmentation of supported nanoparticles in electron microscopy**.

## Installation Guide

### Downloading executables
The application has been exported as an executable for Windows. 
Download these through [Releases](https://github.com/ExtraUnity/NanoparticleAnalysis/releases). These also have pre-trained models ready for use.
Simply download and unzip the application. Then open the **NanoAnalyzer.exe** to start the program. Alternatively use the installer provided.
If only CPU segmentation is needed, we recommend downloading the CPU-only version of the application.

### Running the source code
To run the source code, do the following steps:
0. Clone/download the repository
1. Install Conda
2. Create the Conda environment
3. Run the main.py

#### Installing Conda
An installation guide for Conda can be found [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html)

#### Creating the conda environment
To create the conda environment, run the following commands in the terminal:
1. ```conda env create -f environment.yml```
2. ```conda activate nanoanalyzer```

#### Running the application
To run the application from the source code, run ```python main.py```
