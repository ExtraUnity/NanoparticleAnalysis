# NanoAnalyzer
**NanoAnalyzer** is a user-friendly application for automated segmentation and analysis of supported nanoparticles in electron microscopy images (TEM and STEM).  
It combines a U-Net–based deep learning model with an intuitive graphical interface, allowing materials researchers to:

- segment nanoparticles without writing code,
- process entire folders of images in batch,
- extract particle-level statistics (area, equivalent circular diameter, size distributions),
- and optionally train new models on their own annotated datasets.

NanoAnalyzer is developed by Christian Vedel Petersen & Nikolaj Nguyen originally as part of their bachelor's thesis at the Technical University of Denmark, and later as part of a study on **accessible deep learning for automated segmentation of supported nanoparticles in electron microscopy**.

## Installation Guide

### Downloading executables
The application has been exported as executables for Windows. Download these through [Releases](https://github.com/ExtraUnity/NanoparticleAnalysis/releases). These also have pre-trained models ready for use.
If you want to build the project using the source code, follow the guides below.

### Running the source code
## Install Conda and import the environment.yml based on your OS
0. Conda installation guide https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html 
1. Install pyinstaller with 'pip install pyinstaller'
